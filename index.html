        <h2>My Goals for the School of Engineering Programme</h2>
        <p>
          My primary goal for the School of Engineering programme is to build a
          strong foundation in software development principles and practices. I
          aim to gain expertise in frontend and backend development, learn best
          practices for writing clean and maintainable code, and develop the
          ability to design and implement complex software systems.
          Additionally, I hope to collaborate with my peers on exciting projects
          and build a portfolio that showcases my skills and achievements.
          Lastly, I would like to give back to the School of Engineering by
          contributing to scholarship scheme and volunteer opportunities.
